### Hi there ðŸ‘‹ I'm Erick!

I'm a second-year **Electronic and Electrical Engineering** student at University College London (UCL). Before university, my background was mostly focused on maths and programming, both in **software development** and **competitive algorithmic competitions**.

Currently, my main interests are **electronics** (embedded systems, analog circuit design, control systems) and **software development**, as well as more theoretical subjects such as **computer science** theory and **quantum computing**.
