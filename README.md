### Hi there ðŸ‘‹ I'm Erick!

I'm a first-year Electronic and Electrical Engineering student at University College London (UCL). Before university, my background was mostly focused on maths and programming, both in software development and competitive algorithmic competitions.

Currently, my main interests are electronics (embedded systems, analog circuit design) and software development, as well as more theoretical subjects such as computer science theory and quantum computing.
